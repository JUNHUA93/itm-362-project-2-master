1. Self-critique memo of the project and progress in class in this point:

In this project, I reviewed and deepened my previous knowledge of web design. In addition, by redesigning the login interface code and with the help of other members of the team, I not only learned to code the login screen but also learned how to cater to the needs of users. More importantly, with this project, I realized that the importance of being a team leader is responsible.

2. Critique of each group member's work on the project.

Throughout the process, the team members are very enthusiastic to undertake the task. In addition, each group member is very enthusiastic and responsible to help other members of the group to solve the problem. Most importantly, every member of the group is focused on communicating on every issue. This is important, so I think the rest of the group performed well.
